      <h2>Cookies & LocalStorge</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Cookies and localStorage</b> are both web storage technologies used
        to store data on the user's browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files that are created by websites and stored on
        the user's computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        localStorage, on the other hand, is a client-side storage technology
        that allows web applications to store data on the user's browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both cookies and localStorage are widely used by web developers to
        provide a better user experience and to store information that can be
        used to personalize content and services. However, it is important to
        note that cookies can be used for tracking and other privacy-invasive
        purposes, while localStorage can potentially be accessed by malicious
        actors if the website is compromised.

      <h2>Content Blockers & Add Blockers</h2>
      <p>
        Content blockers and ad blockers are software tools that can be used to
        block unwanted content from being displayed or downloaded on a device.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ad blockers typically block ads displayed on websites, such as banner
        ads, pop-up ads, and video ads. Ad blockers also prevent tracking
        scripts from following a user's online activity, which helps protect
        their privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content blockers, on the other hand, can block a wider range of content,
        such as images, videos, audio, scripts, and even entire websites.
        Content blockers can be used to block adult content, gambling websites,
        social media, and other types of content that may be deemed
        inappropriate or distracting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, ad blockers and content blockers provide a more streamlined and
        private browsing experience for users by blocking unwanted content and
        improving page load times.
